## Abstract

We present a simple baseline for directly estimating the relative pose (rotation and translation, including scale) between two images. We show that a handful of modifications can be applied to a Vision Transformer (ViT) to bring its computations close to the Eight-Point Algorithm. This inductive bias enables a simple method to be competitive in multiple settings, often substantially improving over the state-of-the-art with strong performance gains in limited data regimes.
